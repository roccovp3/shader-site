Experiments with GLSL Shaders using p5.js and a custom website and file structure to display and create new shaders quickly. Nearly all of the intro knowledge on shaders and many of the first few on the webpage come from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mfvZ-mdtZQ).

p5.js is needed for this site to work. As of Jauary 8th, 2024, p5.js is fetched from online. If fetching from the internet fails, p5.js must be downloaded from [their website](https://p5js.org/download/), and references in the HTML must be updated to point to the downloaded copy.
