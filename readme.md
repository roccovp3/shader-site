Experiments with GLSL Shaders using p5.js and a custom website and file structure to display and create new shaders quickly. Nearly all of the intro knowledge on shaders and many of the first few on the webpage come from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mfvZ-mdtZQ).

p5.js is needed for this site to work. To run the site, download the single file [p5.js from here](https://p5js.org/download/) and place it in the top level of this repository.
